So far, pretty much nothing has been done.  Let's fix that!  

We need to :
- Find a database
- Flesh out the basic code 
- Actually have it do something!  (How novel!)
- Have someone who actually knows more than the basics of how to football look over what I (Rob) did and correct any ignorant mistakes made.
...stuff...

Ryan Peters Edit: Hello Guys, I emailed karl and he should be trying to contact you, if not email me. ktnxbai

Glen Noworyta edit: Just seeing if I can push this to GitHub successfully. 10/6/15.

Ryan Peters: Glen and I were working on design, and using JSON and NFL stuff that Karl recommended to Glen, 
when Glen spoke to him at the Career Fair. We are also on the move towards using python. Python is a better 
language to use for this project according to Karl Newell. We are looking to get an initial program finished by thursday, which will just 
pull from this nflgame database. We were able to make a pull from the data base! We will go over this in class on wednesday. 

pdoc.burntsushi.net/nflgame : This is the api we are looking at for python. 
We just need to tinker around with this, and make our own python program that uses it.
