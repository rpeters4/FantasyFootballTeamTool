Heyo, it's 3:40 as I write this, so again, apologies if I'm not awake by the time you start looking this stuff over.  Basically, Matt and I bashed our heads against our computers for several hours and managed to get these data structures/classes together.  They should likely hold everything that we need for the program, and check for redundancy and other such errors.  Working out the logic on those checks after writing the functions that populate the classes is not advised, as we learned pretty well after having a classic python indentation error hide on us for a good hour of me hacking away trying to trace an error...  But yeah, it's working now so hooray!

I also worked out just about every part of the API that we will need in the dump.py file.  The details aren't exactly obvious, but if you run it once with the file pulled up next to it it becomes pretty clear what's happening...  The functions that are included in the API are nice if you're interested in OCD level trivia/stat tracking by hand, but they're pretty much useless for our program.  Fortunately, hiding (well, thinly veiled really...) in the data structures are the gritty details that are really what we need to work with (i.e. not exactly in the prettiest-human readable format, but they're all there and they're all pretty thorough/useful).

recommendation for chris: go into your home directory, open .vimrc and add the lines "set ts=4" and "set expandtab" to prevent any sort of formatting incompatability with the windows IDE that they're all using.  It'll save us some headaches hopefully.

I didn't have time to go through and comment everything in the code, but it's all fairly kinda sorta self explanatory.  All of the information you really will need to get working on anything would be the class declarations (as they contain the data that's actually in the classes in them) and the stuff I worked into the dump.py file.

that said, I've been up for like 21 hours now.  I'm gonna pass out.
