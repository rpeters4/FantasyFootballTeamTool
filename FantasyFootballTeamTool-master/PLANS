So far, pretty much nothing has been done.  Let's fix that!

- Find a database
- Flesh out the basic code 
- Actually have it do something!  (How novel!)
- Have someone who actually knows more than the basics of how to football look over what I (Rob) did and correct any ignorant mistakes made.
...stuff...
